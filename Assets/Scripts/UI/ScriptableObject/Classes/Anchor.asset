  lore: "Former field journalist, Aerith traversed the world to film every war, comment
    each and every conflict, and to show the world what was really happening where
    the media weren't usually allowed. After getting shot in the chest during one
    of her missions, and surviving (not without complications), she unfortunately
    had to take a less \u201Cadventurous\u201D job, and settled to being the anchor
    of one of the most influential news programs that there are. Even if she can\u2019t
    be the one in the eye of the storm, she sure will spread the news to everyone
    else."
