  lore: 'Rocks are magical: they have an energy inside them that is invisible to
    the eye, but effective to the body and mind. Atlantis loves to play around with
    them in her free time, trying to decipher how they influence the energy of things
    around them. She also studies them professionally, and hopes one day to publish
    definitive proof of the magical properties of minerals and stones.'
