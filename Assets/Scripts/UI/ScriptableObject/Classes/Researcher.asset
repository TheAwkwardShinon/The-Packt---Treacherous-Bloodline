  lore: "Time always fascinated Kyren: since he was little, this Moonsighter studied
    theories about how time could be controlled, molded, manipulated. In his eyes,
    people waste a lot of time to then wish for more, want more hours in their days,
    more days in their years, more years in their lives. As if they had all that
    extra time, they could fix any mistake. Here\u2019s the thing about time: for
    Kyren, if you can\u2019t make the most out of any given moment, then you don\u2019t
    deserve a single extra second."
