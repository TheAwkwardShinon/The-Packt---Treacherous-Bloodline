  lore: "Aaron is, at any moment, fully equipped to fight fires... and create their
    own if needed. As both an arsonist and a firefighter, Aaron fully lives a double
    life every day of their existence, and balancing this dynamic really stresses
    them out. Aaron took up arson in their youth as a hobby: it wasn\u2019t really
    a political move, nor a rebellious phase, but it soon turned to an obsession;
    Aaron started to believe they can see visions in the flames they create: that\u2019s
    why they stop the ones created by others in their everyday job."
