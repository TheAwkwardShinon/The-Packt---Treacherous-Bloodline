  lore: "Yubel is a wild card: no one knows his true identity, not even his closer
    friends. He\u2019s a writer, a poet and a rapper, famous in the urban scene.
    One can usually find him dressed as a medieval jester, playing dices with some
    homeless guy on the side of the streets. He always says that his passion for
    storytelling comes from those who are less fortunate: Yubel loves the stories
    that get narrated in the streets, and usually incorporate those urban legends
    in his own works."
