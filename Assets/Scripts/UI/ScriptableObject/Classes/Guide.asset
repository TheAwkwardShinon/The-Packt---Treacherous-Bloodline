  lore: "Antares has always been a people person. He loves to chit-chat about many
    different topics, but especially about the landscapes of his hometown. As a guide,
    his job is to help tourists to deeply experience a new culture foreign to them:
    that\u2019s why, even in his free time, Antares spends every minute researching
    new pieces of history lost in time about this building or that tree, tries to
    explore every little spot, every little business, searching for any new information
    that could give his clients a new insight on the city he so deeply loves and
    cherishes."
