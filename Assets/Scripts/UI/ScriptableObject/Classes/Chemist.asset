  lore: 'Helion is a brilliant scientist that earned a doctorate in chemistry extremely
    young, and used her knowledge to help others up to her twenties: being in close
    contact with dangerous and obscure chemicals on daily basis, though, made her
    no longer think clearly, and she has become hateful and spiteful. Despite this,
    she is still able to express appreciation, being willing to congratulate those
    who have impressed her, especially in the chemical field. Her research has lead
    her to learn many secrets on how the world works, at the cost of unconventional
    and likely unethical experiments.'
