  lore: "Eve has a keen eye: precise, calculative\u2026 a true perfectionist. She
    is really famous, having created many masterpieces in her long lifespan: people
    know her name and speak of her fondly, being one of the most influential people
    of the century. Eve doesn't like the spotlight too much, though. She would much
    rather be in her element, creating beautiful pockets of art in the world, instead
    of being constantly pursued by the media and the fans. That\u2019s why she usually
    goes out undercover, managing to live her world at her own pace."
