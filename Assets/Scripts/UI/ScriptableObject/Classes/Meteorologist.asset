  lore: 'A clouded sky or a sunny day could equally be appreciated under the right
    circumstances: since childhood, Izaya loved to look at the sky and appreciate
    it in each and every one of its forms; a heavy rain would make him energized,
    a snowy day would cleanse his soul, and a rainbow would immediately make him
    happy. Growing up, he started picking up little subtleties in how the sky changed
    its colors, and decided to pursue the meteorological career to make his gift
    available to everyone.'
