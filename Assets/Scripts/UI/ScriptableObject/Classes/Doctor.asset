  lore: 'Kindness alone won''t help you survive in this crazy world. Not all patients
    receive proper care and not all doctors possess a benevolent heart. Naxara is
    definitely not one of that kind-hearthed doctors: she started medical school
    to find a way to improve her physical form even further, having nothing to do
    with helping people or curing sicknesses. As a dietitian she spends most of her
    days hating every overweight patient under her care, regretting her choice of
    choosing medical school over becoming an athlete or a personal trainer.'
