  lore: "Devon is a timid and reserved herbalist: he spends his free time creating
    tinctures and brews, trying to see if any of them could have any beneficial property
    for the body. Even if he\u2019s just out of high school, he has a prominent role
    in the Naturia society as an adept shaman: apparently he\u2019s the reincarnation
    of an old Oracle, so everyone has high expectations for him. But, in his eyes,
    this is just a tiresome charade: he would much rather be a nobody and spend his
    time alone with his plants, free and happy."
