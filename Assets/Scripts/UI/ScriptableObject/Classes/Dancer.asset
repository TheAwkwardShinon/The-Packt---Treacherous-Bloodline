  lore: Sys day begins with her waking up, attending her classes at community college,
    then she proceeds with her afternoon classes at dance school and concludes with
    her job at the night club, where she pole dances for tips. Even if she struggles
    a lot doing everything all the stuff she has to do, she always puts up a smile
    on her face and performs on the stage of life like she would in a theater.
